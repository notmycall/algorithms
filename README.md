# algorithms
This repo consists of several classic sorting and searching algorithms that I have recreated for learning and proofing purposes. 

There are several searching algorithms, but the majority are sorting algorithms. Several of these algorithms will be created via two different approaches: iterative and recursive. Run time is measured using the big O notation though not all the files currently have it declared. All of the algorithms within this repo are written in Python.
